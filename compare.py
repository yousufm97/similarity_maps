        converts input file to a common 2D format for comparisons.
    Inputs:
        oldFile - file containing the original data tensor that is to be converted
        newFile - name of the new file that will contain the data in 2D format
        numCols - number of columns per row. When comparing, you need the same shape.
    Outputs:
        returns nothing but a file containing the data in 2D format has been created.
